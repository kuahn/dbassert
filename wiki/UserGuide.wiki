#summary How to use dbassert library
#labels Phase-Implementation,Featured

= Instructions =
  # Download the library from [http://code.google.com/p/dbassert/downloads/list downloads page].
  # Put it under your classpath.
  # Define your datasources using YAML in some file 
{{{
postgres:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1/test
    username: postgres
    password: postgres
    driver: org.postgresql.Driver

hsqlSource:
    url: jdbc:hsqldb:file:testSrc
    username: sa
    password:
    driver: org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
}}}
  # Intialize DbAssert using with the datasources file and start using it.

==The dependencies are:==
  * [https://sourceforge.net/projects/jyaml JYaml] - JYaml is a Java library for working with the Yaml file format.
All database settings and fixtures use that format.
  * [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=23316 HSQLDB] - if you want to use _fake_ sources, like dbAssert.fake_source("my_fake_source");
in this case in-memory database instance will be created.
