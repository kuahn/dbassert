#labels Phase-Implementation
== Version 0.8.7 (_coming_) ==
1. Got rid of HsqlSource.java
2. Any of sources can accept db schema file now.
{{{
testSource = dbAssert.source("testSource", "org/testfw/TestSourceSchemaFile.sql", DbAssertTest.class);
}}}
this loads the schema file to the datasource. Previously it was possible only for fake_source (HSQLDB).
3. Removed DbAssert::fake_source() method. DbAssert::source() does the same now. For DbAssert there is no difference which datasource you want to use. To use HSQLDB (in-memory, file) specify source like:
{{{
hsqlSource:
    url: jdbc:hsqldb:file:testSrc
    username: sa
    password:
    driver: org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
}}} 

== Version 0.8.6 ==
